              <p>Even though in current society, people are more aware of the importance of renewable energy, cost for using</p>
               <p>electricity still play an important role on motivating household to adapt more sustainable choice. As we can see in the bar chart,</p> 
                <p>the electricity cost in majority states is constantly increasing, by adapting renewable energy such as solar power which government also</p>
               <p> give out various incentive, a household can generally save up to 70% of their bills.</p>

                  <p>Australia has pledged and made several commitments to becoming greener and setting an example for other developed countries to take a stand</p> 
                  <P> against climate change. Therefore, in their effort to becoming part of the solution, they have been making progress in substituting non-renewable</p>
                  <p> sources of energy with renewable sources as can be seen with the gradual growth of depedency on renewable energy with each passing year.</p>
